Notes:
* Monday, 1/10: 10 points were added. As we started collecting data and researching a user story, we realized that that was not the user story we wanted to tell. As such, we pivoted mid-Sprint to split the original user story into 2 user stories. The points added reflect these 2 new user stories. 
* Tuesday, 1/11: 27 points were added. During the sprint, we realized that we had not identified user stories & tasks around our own learning curve to learn the technical skills. We've added these 27 points retroactively to account for our learning curve. For Sprint 2, we added a user story to account for our own learning curve.
